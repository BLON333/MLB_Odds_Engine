    Parameters
    ----------

    book_count : int, optional

    A base movement unit of ``0.0045`` (approximate 15-cent move at one book)

    1. ``time_multiplier``
        Linear decay from ``3.0`` at 24 hours before the game to ``1.0`` at
        game time.
    2. ``book_multiplier``
        Scales stricter when fewer books contribute to the consensus odds. The
        multiplier is ``1.0`` when seven or more books are present and
        increases by ``0.25`` for each missing book (capped at ``2.5`` when only
        one book is available).

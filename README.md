# ‚öæ MLB Monte Carlo Simulation Engine

This project is a modular, data-driven Monte Carlo simulation engine for modeling MLB games and pricing betting markets. It supports game-level, inning-level, and plate appearance-level simulations using player projections, park/weather factors, bullpen fatigue, and more.

---

## üîß Features

- Simulates full MLB games with detailed inning logs
- Weather and park factor adjustments (NOAA-integrated)
- Pitcher fatigue + TTO effects
- Bullpen usage modeling with reliever chaining
- Moneyline and total pricing (with American odds)
- Full slate simulation and PMF summaries
- Modular architecture for plug-and-play enhancements

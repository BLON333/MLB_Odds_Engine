# ‚öæ MLB Monte Carlo Simulation Engine

This project is a modular, data-driven Monte Carlo simulation engine for modeling MLB games and pricing betting markets. It supports game-level, inning-level, and plate appearance-level simulations using player projections, park/weather factors, bullpen fatigue, and more.

---

## üîß Features

- Simulates full MLB games with detailed inning logs
- Weather and park factor adjustments (NOAA-integrated)
- Pitcher fatigue + TTO effects
- Bullpen usage modeling with reliever chaining
- Moneyline and total pricing (with American odds)
- Full slate simulation and PMF summaries
- Modular architecture for plug-and-play enhancements

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib beautifulsoup4 selenium


Download required data:

Batters.csv

Pitchers.csv

Stuff+_Location+.csv

xSLG.csv

reliever_depth_chart_YYYY-MM-DD.json

Set up Selenium ChromeDriver path in lineup_scraper_selenium.py

üß™ Usage Examples

Simulate and price a single game:
python simulate_game_and_price_market.py 2025-04-04-TEX@HOU moneyline


Simulate full distribution (PMF) of total runs:
python cli/run_distribution_simulator.py 2025-04-04-TEX@HOU

Simulate and price entire slate:
python cli/run_full_slate_entry.py 2025-04-04 --csv

Track closing line value:
python cli/closing_odds_monitor.py

Run the full automation loop (which also launches the monitor):
python cli/auto_sim_and_log_loop.py

Windows users can start just the monitor via `launch_closing_odds_monitor.bat`.

## Closing Odds & CLV Tracking

These tools help measure closing line value (CLV) for your logged bets.

* **closing_odds_monitor.py** ‚Äì runs continuously and checks the Odds API for
  games starting within 15 minutes. When closing odds are found it saves a
  snapshot under `data/closing_odds/` and posts a Discord alert summarizing the
  expected value of any logged bets for that game. Set `DISCORD_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`
  in your `.env` to enable alerts.
* **closing_odds_fetcher.py** ‚Äì fetches closing odds for every game ID in your
  `logs/market_evals.csv` and writes a JSON file for the day. Useful after games
  finish if the monitor was not running.
* **update_clv_column.py** ‚Äì merges the saved closing odds back into
  `market_evals.csv`, calculating `clv_percent`, `model_clv_percent` and a
  `clv_class` label for quick filtering.
